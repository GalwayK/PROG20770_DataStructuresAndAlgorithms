// C History and Background 

C was developed in 1972 and was derived from B. It is most famously used to 
develop the unix operating system, and is still used for microcontrollers.

C is considered a low-level high-level language. It still offers substantial 
abstraction from machine code or assembly, but requires management of the 
computer's memory by the programmer. In exchange, C is extremely fast. 

C was standardized in 1989 into what is today kniwn as standard C. This standard
was updated in 1999 into the longest lasting version - C99. A newer standard was 
recently approved called C11 - however it is not widely adopted or supported. 

C is a functional programming language with no supported for object oriented 
paradigms. The C standard library includes a number of function which can be 
used by any C programmer. This functions are likewise extremely optimized.

A number of the most important programming languages have their roots in C. 
These include C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, and many more. 

// C Development Environment 

Editor: The programmer first creates the program in a text editor. 

Preprocessor: The preprocessor processes the code, including handling any 
include statements. 

Compiler: The compiler creates the object code in machine language and stores 
it on the disk. 

Linker: The linker links the object code with the libraries and creates an 
executable file which is stored on the disk. 

Loader: The loader runs the exe file and puts the program into memory. 

// Standard Input, Output, and Error 

Each computer has a stdin, stdout, and stdout. These streams can be redirected. 

// Operating Systems 

Application software runs on operating systems. The core component of an OS is 
the kernel. Windows, Mac, and Linux are the most popular operating systems.

// Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures: Structures used to store data in a computer so they can be used 
efficiently. 

Algorithm: A step by step sequence of instructions to solve a problem. Typically
algorithms work with data structures. 

Together data structures and algorithms are inseparable aspects of computing. 
The first defines how data is stored, the second how data is used. 

Data Structure examples: Arrays, Dynamic Arrays, Stacks, Queues / Buffers, 
Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables.
